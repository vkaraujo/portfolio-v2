    "bio": "I started out learning to build robust web applications with <strong>Ruby on Rails</strong> and <strong>PostgreSQL</strong>, adding <strong>Hotwire</strong> and <strong>Tailwind</strong> for a responsive, dynamic experience. Over time, I dove into <strong>React</strong> and <strong>Vite</strong> to craft rich front-end interactions, explored <strong>Elixir + Phoenix LiveView</strong> to understand real-time systems, and wrote detailed technical documentation to keep projects clear and maintainable. Whether itâ€™s integrating payments with <strong>Safe2Pay</strong>, working with APIs like <strong>TMDB</strong> and <strong>OpenWeather</strong>, or building tools for <strong>Dungeons & Dragons</strong> campaigns, I love combining clean code with engaging user experiences."
